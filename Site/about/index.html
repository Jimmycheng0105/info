        <p>
          <strong>Jimmy Wei-Chun Cheng</strong> is a designer, researcher,
          and educator working at the intersection of architecture,
          artificial intelligence, and media. He is currently a faculty
          member at the School of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prior to joining CMU, he taught studios, workshops, and seminars at
          the Boston Architectural College, the Rhode Island School of Design,
          and the Architectural Association Visiting School Seoul. From 2019
          to 2021, he practiced in Tokyo as a project designer with
          Junya Ishigami + Associates and Sou Fujimoto Architects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cheng’s research investigates how technique, medium, and technology
          transform architectural design processes, with a particular focus
          on multimodal and conversational AI. His work examines how large
          language models, generative image systems, and search-driven
          platforms mediate between information, bodies, climate, and
          architectural form—from domestic interiors to urban configurations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Drawing on semiotics, media theory, cybernetics, and simulation,
          his projects often take the form of tools and interfaces that turn
          archives, dialogue, and environmental data into feedback for
          designers.
