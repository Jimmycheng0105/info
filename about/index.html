        <p>
          <strong>Jimmy Wei-Chun Cheng</strong> is a designer, researcher, and educator working at the intersection of architecture, AI, and media. He is currently a faculty member at the School of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to joining CMU, he taught studios, workshops, and seminars at Boston Architectural College, the Rhode Island School of Design, and the Architectural Association Visiting School Seoul. From 2019 to 2021, he practiced in Tokyo as a project designer with junya ishigami associates and Sou Fujimoto Architects.
        </p>
<p>Cheng’s research investigates how technique, medium, and technology transform the architectural design process, with a particular focus on multimodal and conversational AI. He studies how large language models, generative image systems, and search-driven platforms mediate between information, bodies, climate, and architectural form—from domestic interiors to urban configurations. His work examines how AI reshapes the meanings of language, imagery, and space, drawing on semiotics, media theory, cybernetics, and simulation, and often takes the form of tools and interfaces that turn archives, dialogue, and environmental data into feedback for designers.
</p> <p>Cheng holds a Bachelor of Science in Architecture and Urban Design from the Chinese Culture University in Taiwan; a Master of Architecture from the Rhode Island School of Design; and two post-professional degrees from SCI-Arc—a Master of Science in Architectural Technologies and a Master of Science in Design Theory and Pedagogy—where he received the Hsinming Fung + Craig Hodgetts Postgraduate Thesis Prize.
